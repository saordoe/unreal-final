## UE5 Project Outline
### NPC Dialogue / Interaction
- Relevant files: BP_Korok, S_Dialogue, DT_Dialogue, widget UI blueprints
- Implemented a NPC dialogue system using data tables
- The player must complete a sidequest before the dialogue is able to progress. Below is an example of how the player gets stuck on the "What are you waiting for?" line (controlled by ApplesCompleted/RepeatDialogue).
- Relevant to HW3 </br>

### Bowling Game
- Simple bowling game implemented
- Player can put down a snowball (bowling ball) in the direction they were facing via right mouse click
- I intend to make this more accurate to the Snowball Bowling game at Pondo's Lodge (zelda botw) in the future.
- Relevant to bowling game assignment

### C++ Target Practice 
- Floating targets, C++ version of the original Targets (original target implementation can be tested in **Lvl_Room**, the project is currently defaulted to **Lvl_FirstPerson**)
- Relevant files: BP_NewTarget, C_BPAdvanced (parent class)
- Relevant to HW4

### (WIP) Apples Quest
- Players are able to shoot apples through the regular left click mechanic
- I intend to implement a small mini game where players will have to meet an apple delivery quota by dropping apples in the triggerboxes of the goddess statues.
- Dialogue changes with the NPC will be triggered
